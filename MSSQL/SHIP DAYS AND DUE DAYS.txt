										FROM SALES.SalesOrderDetail 
											GROUP  BY SalesOrderID )

			select H.SalesOrderID, G.TYPES_OF_PARTS, G.TOTAL_QUANTITY, OrderDate, DueDate, ShipDate ,

** DESCRIPTION: 
			
				TO acheive the objective i used datediff to find the diff b/w to dates to know the shiping days and due days
				Additionally i added total quntity and no of parts for a salaes order and carrier tracking number
				To get these data i used subquery to get a temporary result of aggreagted output.
				In subquery i sum of order quantity and count of orderdetailid to total quantity and types of parts
				FOR better readability i used CTE in our query				
				Now i joined both orderdetail , header and CTE to get the objective results
